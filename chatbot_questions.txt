# Chatbot Performance & Intent Guide

This guide categorizes questions by their **Intent** and the number of **LLM Calls** required. 
- **1 LLM Call (⚡ Fast-Path):** Optimized via Regex/Rules to bypass slow intent classification (~5-15s).
- **2 LLM Calls (🧠 Agent Path):** Uses full LangGraph reasoning for complex or ambiguous queries (~60-90s).

## 1. Intent: COUNT (Quantitative Queries)
*Used for counting laboratory results and patient records using SQL.*

### ⚡ 1 LLM Call (Optimized)
- "Total number of abnormal results for patient 10014354?"
- "How many critical labs for patient 10001726?"
- "Total count of results for subject 10014354"

### 🧠 2 LLM Calls (Agentic)
- "Give me the total count of every single patient record in the database."
- "How many distinct types of laboratory tests are available?"
- "What is the count of results that are NOT marked as normal?"

---

## 2. Intent: RISK (Clinical Prediction)
*Triggers the local Random Forest model for patient risk assessment.*

### ⚡ 1 LLM Call (Optimized)
- "What is the clinical risk for patient 10014354?"
- "Calculate the risk level for subject 10001726"
- "Show risk assessment for 10014354"

### 🧠 2 LLM Calls (Agentic)
- "Summarize the clinical risk for patient 10014354 and explain why the glucose is high."
- "Compare the risk level of patient 10014354 with a typical critical patient."
- "Based on the risk data, what are the next clinical steps for subject 10014354?"

---

## 3. Intent: RAG (Knowledge & Retrieval)
*Semantic search in ChromaDB for medical knowledge or patient facts.*

### ⚡ 1 LLM Call (Optimized)
- "What is Glucose?"
- "Explain the meaning of Hemoglobin."
- "Why is high Creatinine dangerous?"

### 🧠 2 LLM Calls (Agentic)
- "Show me all abnormal results for patient 10014354 and explain the science behind them."
- "How does high glucose relate to the other findings for patient 10001726?"
- "List the critical findings for 10014354 and provide a summary for a physician."
